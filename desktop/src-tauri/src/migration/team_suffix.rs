//! Strip the legacy baked team-instructions suffix from stored prompts.
//!
//! Records written before the runtime team framing landed have their team
//! instructions BAKED into `system_prompt` by the now-removed
//! `compose_prompt()` in buzz-persona:
//!
//! ```text
//! {persona_prompt}\n\n---\n# Team Instructions\n{instructions}
//! ```
//!
//! `with_team()` in `buzz-acp/src/pool.rs` now appends the LIVE
//! `[Team Instructions]` section on top of that stored value, so an affected
//! agent receives two team-instruction blocks per turn — the frozen copy first,
//! the live one second — and the observer feed renders two Team Instructions
//! cards. The frozen copy is not merely redundant: it carries whatever the team
//! roster said the day it was written, so the agent is fed a stale roster ahead
//! of the current one.
//!
//! The fix has to happen at rest. Suppressing the duplicate in the observer
//! parser would hide the symptom while the agent kept receiving the stale bytes.
//!
//! Stripping a definition's prompt also changes its `persona_content_hash`, the
//! drift basis behind the Agents-menu "out of date" badge, so the migration
//! advances the pin of instances that were current before the strip (see
//! [`repin_current_instances`]).
